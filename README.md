Please use the "main" branch :)


The current climate of society, particularly schools being held online, impedes students from studying efficiently and getting the most out of their education. Students are more likely to experience difficulty trying to understand course materials and not receive sufficient help with homework, as parents most likely have their hands full considering the situation of the world. Our mission was to provide aid to these students through a light mobile app. The name of our app, PE-ER, is a play on the word “peer” and the Indonesian word “PR”, short for “Pekerjaan Rumah”, which translates to homework.

PE-ER is an iOS application that connects distressed students with willing tutors. Students can select subjects and topics that they need help with and post a request for a tutor, and receive a push notification when a tutor is ready. People willing to take up the role of tutor can register and provide information such as their subject proficiency, and also provide proof of identity for safety reasons.

We prototyped the UI using Figma first and then split tasks between team members, specifically the front and back-end. The back-end was written in swift and heavily utilized development tools provided by Firebase. We implemented the MVC design pattern to develop the UI and data that flow around it.

We had some decisions to make with features, such as what verification is required for students and teachers, and how exactly will students be connected to teachers. Through this process, we realized that we have to account both parties in developing our app, to make sure both would be satisfied with the provided features.

Good things to improve on the app would be to add more screening for tutors, and perhaps allow students to create accounts to save their collaboration sessions.
